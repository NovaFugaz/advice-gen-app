## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Generate a new piece of advice by clicking the dice icon

### Screenshot

The app was created using React. It has the functionality and it works as intended. I had some issues getting the favicon but I converted it to .ico and changed the name and worked like a charm.

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

First of all, I had never done before anything using React, so everything was new.

It was interesting to read this.

```html
This HTML file is a template.
If you open it directly in the browser, you will see an empty page.
```

It was also interesting to read this, as I was not accustomed to make this imports in the "header" of the js.

```js
import React, {useState, useEffect} from 'react'
import dividerDesktop from './img/pattern-divider-desktop.svg'
import dividerMobile from './img/pattern-divider-mobile.svg'
import dice from './img/icon-dice.svg'
import axios from 'axios'
```

Also the structure of the React App was interesting to see.
